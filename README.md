## Contributing to the Documentation or Website

Good documentation is crucial for any kind of software. You can help improving the documentation:
* Please report missing, incorrect, or out-dated documentation as an [issue](https://github.com/kaikramer/keystore-explorer/issues).
* The [KSE website](https://keystore-explorer.org) is in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kaikramer/kaikramer.github.io) just like the KSE source code, which means improvements for the website can be contributed in the same way as code contributions. Or you could open an [issue](https://github.com/kaikramer/keystore-explorer/issues) if you think the website could be improved, but don't want to do it yourself.
