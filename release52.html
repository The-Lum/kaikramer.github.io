            This release comes with another translation: German (contributed by Frank Dietrich).
            <p>
                <p>
                    It also includes the following bug fixes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed problem that Java runtimes with three-digit version number (e.g. 8u101) were not found
                            by the Windows launcher (kse.exe).</li>
                        <li>Fixed authorityCertIssuer in AKI extension (patch contributed by Peter Breur).</li>
                        <li>Fixed problem when generating EC keys with crypto devices (patch provided by Andreas Schwier).</li>
                        <li>Ignoring unsupported certificate types now (patch provided by Andreas Schwier).</li>
                        <li>Java 8 update 101 finally fixed a problem with duplicate aliases in MSCAPI keystore,
                            which caused an exception in the workaround code in KSE when opening the Windows-MY keystore. The
                            workaround code has been removed now from KSE (reported by Helmut Schulz).</li>
                        <li>Fixed compatibility problems of jar signatures in combination with older Java versions (reported by dmacjr).</li>
                        <li>Fixed problem with missing start menu entries in Windows 10 (reported by bennypi).</li>
                        <li>Fixed last used PKCS#11 libraries not being stored in preferences (reported by Uri Blumenthal).</li>
                        <li>Removal of crypto restrictions works again now.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The included Bouncy Castle library has been updated to version 1.55.

            KeyStore Explorer 5.2.1 is a maintenance release. It includes fixes for the following issues:
            <ul>
                <li>On Mac OS X opening a file froze KSE when there are other applications installed that use the accessability API (reported by ke5stl and Markus Rudel).
                    As a workaround for this incompatibility the native file dialog has been removed for OS X.</li>
                <li>The shell script (kse.sh) didn't start through a symlink because it incorrectly detected its parent folder (fix contributed by Josef Ludvicek).</li>
                <li>NPE in NameConstraints extension when there is no max. value in excludedSubtrees (reported by Ruffin).</li>
                <li>After opening a MSCAPI or PKCS11 keystore, the restrictions for export etc. were applied to all other keystore types as well.</li>
                <li>ExamineFile/ExamineClipboard: When there were multiple concatenated PEM certs in one file, KSE showed only the first one.</li>
                <li>A very rarely occurring bug in JEditorPane's constructor caused exceptions on startup.</li>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>KeyStore Explorer version 5.2 is a huge feature release, adding more than 30 new features and enhancements.</p>
        <p>It is the first version of KSE that can access hardware keystores like smart cards and hardware security modules (HSMs)
            using the PKCS#11 and MSCAPI providers.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">New Feature: MSCAPI Keystore Type</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Since Java 6 the <b>SunMSCAPI provider</b> is part of the JRE, enabling software written in Java to access the
            native cryptographic services and key containers of the Windows platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far KSE only allowed to use "Windows-ROOT" as a truststore ("Preferences" -&gt; "Authority Certificates").
        </p>
        <p>
            In KSE 5.2 you can now open the "<b>Windows-MY</b>" keystore (s. screenshot), which contains the user's personal certificates
            and associated private keys. This includes keys that are located on a smart card, as long as the matching middleware
            is installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that due to restrictions of the SunMSCAPI provider not all features are available, that would be available
            for other keystore types.
        </p>
    </div>

        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 class="h3">New Feature: PKCS#11 Keystore Type</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            PKCS#11 is a standard that defines an API for accessing cryptographic devices. In Java the <b>SunPKCS11
                provider</b> wraps the PKCS#11 API and transforms it into the keystore API.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to use a PKCS#11 library in KSE:
            <ol>
                <li>Add the SunPKCS11 provider to the Java Security properties file. This is described in detail in the
                    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html">Java PKCS#11 Reference Guide</a>
                    and also often in the documentation of the cryptographic device. You can then simply select it in KSE
                    in the "Open PKCS#11 KeyStore" dialog.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternatively, KSE can register the SunPKCS11 provider itself, if you provide the path to the
                    PKCS#11 library and the right slot index.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that because PKCS#11 libraries are native code you have to make sure that both the JRE and the
            PKCS#11 library are either 32 or 64 bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The combination of SunPKCS11 provider, middleware and hardware often does not work very well together:
            Sometimes the token can be opened, but not be used for signing, sometimes not even opening the token works.
            As a rule of thumb, if it works with keytool/jarsigner, then it should work with KSE as well. Please avoid
            opening bug reports about device xy not working in KSE. It's only a bug if it works in keytool/jarsigner
            but not in KSE.
        </p>

</div>


<h2 class="h3">New Feature: Timestamping Jar Signatures</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            KSE can now generate and store a signature timestamp when signing a JAR file. All you have to do is select
            the option "Add Timestamp" in the sign jar dialog and choose a <b>Time Stamping Authority (TSA)</b> from a list
            (or enter the URL of another TSA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The following URLs of TSAs are pre-defined:
            <ul>
                <li>https://timestamp.geotrust.com/tsa</li>
                <li>http://tsa.starfieldtech.com</li>
                <li>http://www.startssl.com/timestamp</li>
                <li>http://timestamp.globalsign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll</li>
                <li>http://timestamp.comodoca.com/rfc3161</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            KSE communicates with the TSA using the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) defined in <b>RFC 3161</b>. The timestamp token
            returned by the TSA is stored along with the signature in the signature block file.
        </p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The three previously separate features "Examine Certificate", "Examine CSR" and "Examine CRL" have been
            combined into "Examine File". KSE detects the content of the file and opens it if it is certificate,
            a CSR, a CRL or a keystore.

<h2 class="h3">System Clipboard Integration</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Sometimes you have a PEM encoded certificate or CSR in a mail, on a website or in a larger text document
            and want to see the content. Normally this means to copy the lines into a new text file, save it somewhere
            on the hard disk and then open the file with KSE or another certificate viewer. It would be so much easier
            to directly open the certificate from the clipboard. That's what "Examine Clipboard" does.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            If you have transmitted a CSR and the CA shows the issued certificate in PEM format on its website or sends
            it in PEM format in an email, then you can simply copy it and use the new "Import CA reply from Clipboard"
            feature.

<h2 class="h3">New Option: Use System Proxy Settings</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            In previous versions of KSE it was necessary to enter the proxy configuration manually. KSE 5.2 can now
            detect and use the proxy settings of the operating system, which should work in most cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the new default setting.
