            KeyStore Explorer version 5.0 is the first open source release of KSE since 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
            It comprises all the new features that were projected for KSE 4.2 plus a few smaller enhancements.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to replace a commercial library that was extensively used by earlier versions of KSE and that impeded the switch to an open source license,
            more than 2000 code changes were made. In addition the commercial icon set of KSE 4.1.1 and before was replaced with a CC-licensed one.
